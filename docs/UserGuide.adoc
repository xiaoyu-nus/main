== Introduction

Xpire is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for tracking expiry dates of items*. More importantly, Xpire is *optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you have trouble tracking your items' expiry dates, Xpire can help you manage and notify you of items that are soon-expiring. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. HAJIMASHOUKA?
